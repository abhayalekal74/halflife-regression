# Half-Life Regression

Half-life regression (HLR) is a model for spaced repetition practice, with particular applications to second language acquisition. The model marries psycholinguistic theory with modern machine learning techniques, indirectly estimating the "half-life" of words (and potentially any other item or fact) in a student's long-term memory.
